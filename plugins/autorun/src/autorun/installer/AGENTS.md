# The installer

`CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md` are symlinks here. Edit this file.

## One idea

**Status, dry run, install, uninstall, prune are one traversal, three modes.**
All ask: what is here, is it ours, does it match what we ship?

| Mode | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PREVIEW` | prints, writes nothing. Status *is* dry run |
| `INSTALL` | acts on `PUBLISH` and `RETIRE` |
| `UNINSTALL` | same walk, sources dropped, so all `RETIRE` |

`decide()` takes `source: Path \| None`; `None` is the retirement question, not a
special case. Mode does not decide scope: `decide(plugin=...)` and `fs.owns` do,
so `--uninstall pdf-extractor` cannot touch autorun's trees.

## Three rules

1. **Only `fs` mutates:** `publish_tree`, `publish_files`, `withdrawn`,
   `withdraw_files`, `json_document`. Each records a manifest, so an
   unidentifiable tree cannot be created.
2. **Steps yield `Intent`s and touch no disk.** That is why no `dry_run` parameter
   is threaded anywhere.
3. **Harness differences are data.** Nothing in `traversal.py` names a harness.

## Who owns which question

| Question | Owner. Never re-derive elsewhere |
|---|---|
| Where does this harness keep config? | `discovery.config_dir` (CONFIG override → env var → default) |
| Extensions dir, or none? | `discovery.extensions_dir`, where `None` is a real answer |
| Where do skills go / come from? | `discovery.skill_destinations(reading=…)` |
| Is this tree ours? | `fs.owns` (+ `PLUGIN_ALIASES` for old markers) |
| May we write here? | `fs.decide` / `fs.decide_files` |
| Where is the marketplace / a plugin? | `discovery.marketplace_root`, `plugin_dir` |
| What did the user configure? | `settings.INSTALL_SETTINGS`, resolved once at entry |

## Modules

`fs` owned trees, marker+hash manifest, atomic JSON · `traversal` walk, modes,
`Intent`, retirement sweep · `discovery` roots, plugins, dirs · `settings` one
declaration → resolution, help, parsers · `skills` routes, blocking, bridge ·
`memory` sentinel region · `runtime` uv, probe, bootstrap, self-update, daemon ·
`harness` TOML + placeholders · `codex` hooks, marketplace · `extension`
materialize + refresh.

## Exact names. A wrong one is silent, never an error

| | Owner |
|---|---|
| `gemini-extension.json`, fixed. Not `<name>-extension.json`. All three family CLIs | `extension.MANIFEST_NAME` |
| `<ext>/hooks/hooks.json`. The manifest's own `hooks` field is ignored | `extension.stage_extension` |
| `.<cli>-extension-install.json` receipt, per harness | `extension.RECEIPT_GLOB` |
| `.autorun-owned` · `.autorun-install.lock` (in the **parent**) | `fs.OWNED_MARKER_NAME`, `INSTALL_LOCK_NAME` |
| Codex top level: only `description`, `hooks`. Any other key drops **every** hook | `codex.ALLOWED_TOP_LEVEL` |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | `discovery.MARKETPLACE_MANIFEST` |

Harness-owned, never ours: `qwen-extension.json` and the
`*-extension-install.json` receipts.

## Extending

**Harness:** register the `Platform`, add a step-table row. A *custom* harness
clones its flavor's entry and reuses that flavor's steps, so no branch is needed.

**Capability:** `f(harness, ctx) -> Iterable[Intent]`, listed in the step tuples
that need it. No disk access: stage generated content to a temp dir and point the
`Intent` there, as `extension.stage_extension` does.

## Traps

- **A user edit in an owned tree is kept.** `decide()` returns `KEEP` and names
  the files. No force path may ignore it. The one thing `--force` widens is a
  tree whose marker predates file hashes (`files: []`): without hashes an edit
  and a stale copy are indistinguishable, so a plain install or uninstall keeps
  it and says so, and `--force` republishes it (source still shipped) or
  retires it (route no longer shipped, or `--uninstall`) after the current
  tree is copied to `~/.autorun/installer/backups/` by `fs._park_backup`
  (never beside the skill — a harness would list the backup as a skill).
- **Shared dirs are owned per file.** For `commands/` use
  `publish_files`/`withdraw_files`. `publish_tree` there either refuses or
  deletes the user's files.
- **A colliding shipped file is backed up, not skipped.** The shipped set must
  be complete or the package is broken: skipping the user's `ar-go.md` leaves
  `/ar:go` absent while the install reports success. Their content moves to
  `ar-go.md.autorun-backup`, numbered when backups stack, and is named in the
  decision so the caller can report it. A file that matches what we recorded is
  replaced with no backup. Pass `backup=False` where a fallback exists, as a
  blocked skill still has its harness's native route.
- **Stage skills by name, never by directory.** Copying a whole `skills/` into an
  extension gave shared-root harnesses two unmarked, unprunable copies.
- **Markers say `ar` everywhere.** A tree recorded as `autorun` was unremovable
  under `ar`, which leaked 362 files.
- **A step knows only today's paths.** The sweep (`traversal.retirements`)
  visits selected harnesses' config roots, so a retired route *inside* one is
  found by its marker. A retired route *outside* every root is not: declare
  it in `Platform.retired_config_dirs` (Antigravity's
  `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/`), or its trees leak forever carrying our
  marker and no decision names them.
- **Versioned harness caches belong to the harness.**
  `<config>/plugins/cache/<market>/<plugin>/<version>/` may copy an ownership
  marker from the registered source tree. The retirement sweep ignores that
  path: deleting it would remove state Claude or Codex still tracks. Claude's
  fallback cache writer proves ownership by path and deliberately writes no
  marker.
- **Never `uv tool uninstall` a name whose console script is also ours.** uv
  removes scripts by *name*, not by owner, and every uv tool shares one bin
  directory. Measured, with `autorun-ai` installed and providing all three:
  `uv tool uninstall autorun` printed "Uninstalled 3 executables: autorun,
  autorun-install, extract-pdfs", and `uv tool uninstall
  autorun-pdf-extractor` printed "Uninstalled 1 executable: extract-pdfs" —
  the second already shipped. Restoring them is not possible from a uv tool
  install: the only local path is `.../site-packages/autorun`, the import
  package, which `uv tool install` refuses. So
  `entrypoint._retire_legacy_distributions` keeps such a distribution and
  reports it with the command to reclaim the disk. The pip route still sweeps —
  a pip-installed retired package owns its own environment.
- **The installer runs before its dependencies exist.** `hooks/hook_entry.py` is
  stdlib-only; on `ImportError` it spawns an install of *this source* — the
  plugin directory when it has a `pyproject.toml`, else `BOOTSTRAP_SOURCE`, the
  git URL — followed by `python -m autorun --install`, and the next hook finds
  the deps. It never installs a bare distribution name. So a missing
  dependency must surface as an `ImportError` at import: any other exception is
  caught by `run_fallback`'s `except Exception`, which fails open and never
  bootstraps, leaving autorun permanently uninstalled. `filelock` in `fs` is the
  package's only third-party import, and `config.py` is stdlib-only, which is
  what makes `settings.autorun_config()` safe to call mid-install. Adding a
  dependency, or a module-scope call that raises anything else, breaks this.
- **Read routes and write routes differ.** Antigravity reads
  `~/.gemini/config/skills` and writes its plugins dir; ForgeCode reads
  `~/forge/skills` and writes nowhere. The bridge targets read routes.
- **A native copy the harness made is proven ours by receipt plus content,
  never by name.** Gemini and Qwen record the source path in
  `.<cli>-extension-install.json`. Agy records only `{"name": "ar", "source":
  "antigravity"}` in `~/.gemini/config/import_manifest.json`, so for Agy the
  content half is an exact match with today's source, or every hook command
  running our `hook_entry.py` (`extension.bundle_hooks_are_ours`), or a copied
  skill carrying our marker (hookless pdf-extractor). Exact match alone holds
  only until the source next changes; requiring it left Agy on its first
  bundle forever, silently. A same-name plugin that fails the proof is the
  user's and the skip is a `FAIL` outcome naming the path.
- **A root `gemini-extension.json` is a template.** `steps.extension_template`
  is the one owner: `gemini_template/` when present, else the plugin directory
  when the manifest sits at its root (pdf-extractor), else no extension.

## Isolation

The rule, the sandbox recipe, and the proof are in the root `AGENTS.md` and
[`docs/RUNTIME_STATE_ISOLATION.md`](../../../docs/RUNTIME_STATE_ISOLATION.md).
Installer specifics:

- `HOME` is the seam; `Context.home` must **agree** with `$HOME` and is checked.
  Setting the field alone reads a sandbox and writes the real home — that
  uninstalled 16 live skills during a self-check that looked isolated. Use
  `discovery.redirected_home(path)` in any demo or test that needs a home.
- Redirecting `$HOME` does not move the daemon: `ipc.AUTORUN_CONFIG_DIR` is
  fixed at import. An in-process self-check that later runs `uninstall()` with
  teardown on signals the developer's live daemon (`orchestrate.demo` did).
  Set `AUTORUN_HOME` before the first import, or stand in for
  `teardown.stop_daemon` as `orchestrate._exercise` and `teardown.demo` do.
- `AUTORUN_HOME` must be short: the daemon socket lives under it, `sun_path` is
  104 bytes on macOS, and overflow looks like a hook timeout.

## Checks

Every module self-checks, from the repository root (`plugins/autorun/autorun.py`
shadows the package if you `cd` in first):
`uv run --project plugins/autorun python -c "from autorun.installer.fs import demo; demo()"`.
Named tests live in `plugins/autorun/tests/test_install_*.py`.

`test_install_gotchas.py::test_every_installer_module_self_check_passes` runs
that command for each module, discovering them rather than listing them, so a
new module's `demo()` is covered the moment it exists. Until it was added the
claim above was unverified and `registration.demo()` had been failing for eight
days: it asserted every `REGISTRATIONS` key was a bare harness name, which
stopped being true when the `codex:<marketplace>` variants arrived.
