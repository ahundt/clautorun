Autorun v0.7 Client - Thin Forwarder to Daemon

Forwards hook payloads to daemon via Unix socket.
Auto-starts daemon if not running.
Fails open on any errors.

Hook Exit Codes:
----------------
Exit code 0 = hook succeeded (even when denying tool access)
Exit code 2 = blocking ERROR causing "hook error"

The JSON permissionDecision: "deny" blocks the tool, not exit code.

    startup -- plus a ``uv run`` resolve, which is not cheap on Windows -- comes
