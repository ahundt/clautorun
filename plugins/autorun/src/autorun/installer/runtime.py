"""How autorun invokes uv, and what it learns about the runtime it selected.

One command builder. The code this replaces has two: ``_render_uv_hook_command``
assembles a *shell string* for the hook manifest, and
``probe_hook_python_architecture`` assembles an *argv list* to probe the same
interpreter. They repeat the same flags — ``run --quiet``, ``--no-sync``,
``--project``, ``--python`` — and nothing keeps them in step, so a flag added
for the hook is missing from the probe that is supposed to verify the hook.

Here a command is built once as argv and *rendered* to a shell string only where
a manifest demands a string. Building the two forms from one description is what
makes them incapable of disagreeing.

Why this matters more than it looks: a hook manifest is read once at session
start, and a wrong flag there does not raise — the hook simply produces stderr,
which Claude Code treats as a hook failure and silently disables every hook for
the session while everything still looks healthy.

Complexity: building is O(flags). The probe runs one subprocess with a timeout
and is called by install and status only, never on a hook path.
