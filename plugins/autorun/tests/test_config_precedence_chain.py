"""Settings resolve CLI parameter > environment > config file > default.

Three tiers existed. The file tier did not: three per-feature config files had
three separate loaders (`plan-export.config.json`, `plan-notify.config.json`,
`task-lifecycle.config.json`) and none of them backed the CONFIG dict, so a
user could tune those three features from a file and nothing else.

The file is overlaid onto CONFIG at import rather than consulted at each of the
fifty-odd `CONFIG.get` call sites. That is what makes the tier arrive
everywhere at once instead of wherever someone remembered to add it, and it is
why an absent file changes nothing: with no file, CONFIG holds exactly the
values its source declares.

Environment variables still win, because the resolvers that read them consult
the environment before CONFIG. That ordering is the point of the chain: a
setting exported for one session must not be overridden by a file written for
the machine.
